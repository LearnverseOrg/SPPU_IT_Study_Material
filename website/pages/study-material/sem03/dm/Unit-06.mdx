# Unit 6: Algebraic Structures

## Introduction to Algebraic Structures

Algebraic structures are essential concepts in modern mathematics, providing a framework to study various operations and their properties. They help in understanding how elements within a set interact with each other under a defined operation. In this unit, we will explore key algebraic structures such as **Semigroups**, **Monoids**, **Groups**, **Rings**, **Fields**, and their applications. These structures have profound implications in areas like cryptography, coding theory, and computer science.

## Semigroup

### Definition of a Semigroup

A **Semigroup** is an algebraic structure consisting of a set $S$ together with a binary operation $*$ that combines two elements to form another element of the set. The operation must satisfy the **associativity** property, which means that for all elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $S$:

$$
(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
$$

However, a semigroup does not require an identity element or inverses for its operation. An example of a semigroup is the set of natural numbers $N$ under addition, where associativity holds, but there is no identity element in the semigroup.

### Example

Consider the set $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$ with the operation of multiplication. This set is a semigroup because multiplication is associative:

$$
(1 \times 2) \times 3 = 1 \times (2 \times 3)
$$

Thus, the set forms a semigroup under multiplication.

## Monoid

### Definition of a Monoid

A **Monoid** is a semigroup with an additional requirement: it must contain an **identity element**. This identity element, denoted as $e$, satisfies the property that for every element $a$ in the set $M$, the following holds:

$$
a * e = e * a = a
$$

In other words, combining any element with the identity element under the operation does not change the element. The set of natural numbers $N$ with addition, and 0 as the identity element, is an example of a monoid.

### Example

The set of non-negative integers $M = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}$ under the operation of addition is a monoid. The number 0 acts as the identity element because:

$$
a + 0 = 0 + a = a \text{ for all } a \in M
$$

## Group

### Definition of a Group

A **Group** is a monoid with the added property that every element must have an **inverse**. A group is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $*$ such that:

1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
2. **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that $a * e = e * a = a$ for all $a \in G$.
3. **Inverses**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

Groups are central in various mathematical fields, including geometry and algebra.

### Example

Consider the set of integers $Z$ under addition. The identity element is 0, and each integer $n$ has an inverse $-n$, since:

$$
n + (-n) = (-n) + n = 0
$$

Thus, the set of integers forms a group under addition.

## Abelian Group

### Definition of an Abelian Group

An **Abelian Group** (or commutative group) is a group in which the binary operation is **commutative**. This means that for all elements $a$ and $b$ in the group, the operation satisfies:

$$
a * b = b * a
$$

In addition to the usual group properties (associativity, identity, and inverses), Abelian groups are characterized by this commutative property, which makes them easier to work with in many applications.

### Example

The set of real numbers $R$ under addition forms an Abelian group. For any two real numbers $a$ and $b$:

$$
a + b = b + a
$$

Thus, real numbers form an Abelian group under addition.

## Permutation Groups

### Definition of a Permutation Group

A **Permutation Group** is a set of permutations of a finite set $S$ that is closed under composition and inverses. A **permutation** is a rearrangement of the elements of a set. If $S$ is a set with $n$ elements, the **Symmetric Group** $S_n$ is the group of all permutations of $S$.

Permutation groups are particularly useful in the study of symmetry and are used in many areas of mathematics, including algebra and combinatorics.

### Example

Consider the set $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$. The symmetric group $S_3$ consists of all possible permutations of $S$. These include:

$$
(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)
$$

These permutations form a group under composition.

## Cosets and Normal Subgroups

### Cosets

A **coset** is a subset of a group formed by multiplying all elements of the group by a fixed element. If $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$ and $g$ is an element of $G$, the **left coset** of $H$ with respect to $g$ is:

$$
gH = \{g * h : h \in H\}
$$

Similarly, the **right coset** is defined as:

$$
Hg = \{h * g : h \in H\}
$$

Cosets are used in the study of group structure and are important in understanding quotient groups.

### Normal Subgroups

A **Normal Subgroup** is a subgroup $N$ of a group $G$ such that the left coset of $N$ is equal to the right coset for every element $g$ in $G$. In other words, $N$ is normal if:

$$
gN = Ng \text{ for all } g \in G
$$

Normal subgroups are crucial in the construction of quotient groups and play a central role in the study of group homomorphisms.

## Ring

### Definition of a Ring

A **Ring** is an algebraic structure consisting of a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication. The set must satisfy the following properties:

1. **Additive Group**: The set $R$ under addition is an Abelian group.
2. **Multiplication is Associative**: For all $a, b, c \in R$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
3. **Distributive Laws**: Multiplication distributes over addition:
   $$ a _ (b + c) = a _ b + a _ c $$
   $$ (a + b) _ c = a _ c + b _ c $$

Rings can either be **commutative** (if multiplication is commutative) or **non-commutative**.

### Example

The set of integers $Z$ under the usual addition and multiplication forms a commutative ring.

## Integral Domain

### Definition of an Integral Domain

An **Integral Domain** is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. A **zero divisor** is a non-zero element $a$ in a ring such that there exists a non-zero element $b$ with $a * b = 0$. In an integral domain, the product of two non-zero elements is always non-zero.

### Example

The set of integers $Z$ forms an integral domain, as there are no zero divisors in $Z$.

## Field

### Definition of a Field

A **Field** is an algebraic structure in which both addition and multiplication are defined and behave similarly to the arithmetic of real numbers. A field is a set $F$ with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy the following properties:

1. **Additive Group**: The set $F$ under addition is an Abelian group.
2. **Multiplicative Group**: The non-zero elements of $F$ under multiplication form an Abelian group.
3. **Distributive Law**: Multiplication distributes over addition.

Fields are important in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and geometry.

### Example

The set of rational numbers $Q$ forms a field under the usual addition and multiplication.

## Codes and Group Codes

### Introduction to Codes

**Codes** are methods used to transform data into a form that can be efficiently transmitted or stored. **Group codes** refer to a type of error-correcting code where the codewords form a group under a particular operation. These codes are used in data transmission and storage to detect and correct errors.

## Applications of Algebraic Structures

Algebraic structures have several practical applications in fields such as cryptography, coding theory, and computer science. **Groups** are used in symmetry analysis in physics and chemistry, while **rings** and **fields** form the foundation of coding theory and

cryptography.
