# Unit 2: Transforms

## Introduction to Fourier and Z-Transforms

Transforms are mathematical tools used to convert a function from one domain to another. In this unit, we will cover two important transforms: the **Fourier Transform (FT)** and the **Z-Transform (ZT)**. These transforms have wide applications in signal processing, control systems, image processing, and more.

## Fourier Transform (FT)

The **Fourier Transform** helps in analyzing functions by decomposing them into sine and cosine waves. It is particularly useful in studying signals and systems in the frequency domain.

### Complex Exponential Form of Fourier Series

The Fourier series represents a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. When expressed in complex exponential form, the series becomes:

$$ f(x) = \sum\_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} C_n e^{i n \omega_0 x} $$

where $C_n$ are the Fourier coefficients, and $\omega_0$ is the fundamental frequency.

#### Example:

For a square wave with period $2\pi$, the Fourier series is:

$$ f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum\_{n=1,3,5...}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin(nx) $$

### Fourier Integral Theorem

The **Fourier Integral Theorem** states that a function can be represented by an integral of sinusoidal components if it is not periodic but decays to zero at infinity.

#### Example:

For a function $f(t)$ that decays at infinity, its Fourier integral is:

$$ f(t) = \int\_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i \omega t} d\omega $$

where $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(t)$.

### Fourier Sine and Cosine Integrals

The **Fourier Sine and Cosine Integrals** decompose a function into only sine or cosine terms. These are useful when dealing with odd or even functions.

#### Example:

For an odd function $f(t)$, the Fourier sine integral is:

$$ f(t) = \int_0^{\infty} F_s(\omega) \sin(\omega t) d\omega $$

### Fourier Transform (FT)

The **Fourier Transform** converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation:

$$ F(\omega) = \int\_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} dt $$

#### Example:

The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function $f(t) = e^{-t^2}$ is:

$$ F(\omega) = \sqrt{\pi} e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{4}} $$

### Fourier Sine and Cosine Transforms

These transforms use sine and cosine functions rather than exponentials.

- **Fourier Sine Transform (FST):**

$$ F_s(\omega) = \int_0^{\infty} f(t) \sin(\omega t) dt $$

- **Fourier Cosine Transform (FCT):**

$$ F_c(\omega) = \int_0^{\infty} f(t) \cos(\omega t) dt $$

#### Example:

For $f(t) = e^{-t}$, the Fourier sine transform is:

$$ F_s(\omega) = \frac{\omega}{1 + \omega^2} $$

### Inverse Fourier Transform

To recover the time-domain signal from its frequency-domain form, the inverse Fourier transform is used:

$$ f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i \omega t} d\omega $$

## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

The **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** is used when dealing with discrete data points. It converts a sequence of values into components of different frequencies.

### Definition

For a sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$, the DFT is given by:

$$ X[k] = \sum\_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{N} kn} $$

#### Example:

For a sequence $x[n] = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, the DFT computes the frequency components of this sequence.

## Z-Transform (ZT)

The **Z-Transform** is a powerful tool for analyzing discrete-time systems. It is the discrete counterpart of the Laplace transform and is widely used in digital signal processing.

### Introduction and Definition

The Z-transform of a discrete sequence $x[n]$ is defined as:

$$ X(z) = \sum\_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n} $$

where $z$ is a complex number.

### Standard Properties of Z-Transform

1. **Linearity:** If $X(z)$ and $Y(z)$ are the Z-transforms of $x[n]$ and $y[n]$, respectively, then:

   $$ aX(z) + bY(z) \text{ is the Z-transform of } ax[n] + by[n] $$

2. **Time Shifting:** If $X(z)$ is the Z-transform of $x[n]$, then the Z-transform of $x[n-k]$ is:

   $$ z^{-k} X(z) $$

### Z-Transform of Standard Sequences

1. **Unit Step Function:** The Z-transform of $u[n] = 1$ for $n \geq 0$ is:

   $$ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}, \quad |z| > 1 $$

2. **Exponential Sequence:** The Z-transform of $x[n] = a^n u[n]$ is:

   $$ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - az^{-1}}, \quad |z| > |a| $$

#### Example:

For $x[n] = 2^n u[n]$, the Z-transform is:

$$ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}}, \quad |z| > 2 $$

### Inverse Z-Transform

The **Inverse Z-Transform** is used to recover the original sequence from its Z-transform:

$$ x[n] = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint X(z) z^{n-1} dz $$

Alternatively, partial fraction decomposition or power series expansion methods can be used.

## Solving Difference Equations Using Z-Transform

The Z-transform can be applied to solve linear difference equations. Consider the equation:

$$ x[n+2] - 3x[n+1] + 2x[n] = 0 $$

Taking the Z-transform:

$$ z^2 X(z) - 3zX(z) + 2X(z) = 0 $$

Solving for $X(z)$, we can use the inverse Z-transform to find the solution in the time domain.
