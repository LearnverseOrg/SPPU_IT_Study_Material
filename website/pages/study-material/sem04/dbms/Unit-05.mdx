# Unit 5: Transaction & Concurrency Control

## Transaction Management

### Basic Concept of a Transaction

A **transaction** is a unit of work that includes one or more database operations, such as reading or writing data. It represents a sequence of operations that should be treated as a single logical unit of work. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction should fail.

Examples of transactions include:

- Transferring money between bank accounts.
- Updating an inventory after a sale.

### Properties of Transactions (ACID)

Transactions must adhere to the following properties, commonly referred to as **ACID**:

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit. All operations either complete successfully or fail together.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database integrity.
3. **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are executed independently and transparently without interference from other transactions.
4. **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its results are permanent, even in the event of a system crash.

### Database Architecture

The architecture for transaction management includes:

- **Transaction manager**: Manages transaction execution.
- **Scheduler**: Ensures that transactions are properly ordered.
- **Concurrency control manager**: Handles concurrent transactions.
- **Recovery manager**: Ensures the system can recover from failures.

### Concept of Schedule

A **schedule** is a sequence of operations from a set of transactions. It describes how operations are interleaved in time. The goal of scheduling is to ensure that transactions maintain **consistency**.

### Serial Schedule

A **serial schedule** is a schedule in which transactions are executed one after the other, with no interleaving. This ensures the correctness of transactions but may not always be efficient in terms of performance.

## Serializability

### Conflict Serializability

A schedule is **conflict serializable** if it can be transformed into a **serial schedule** by swapping non-conflicting operations. Operations are in conflict if they involve the same data item, and at least one of them is a write operation.

### View Serializability

A schedule is **view serializable** if the order of reads and writes in the schedule produces the same final outcome as some serial schedule, even if operations cannot be swapped as in conflict serializability.

### Cascaded Aborts

In some schedules, the failure of one transaction can lead to the rollback of other dependent transactions. These are called **cascaded aborts**, and they can be avoided by ensuring that transactions only read committed data.

### Recoverable and Non-recoverable Schedules

- **Recoverable schedules**: Ensure that transactions are only allowed to commit if all transactions whose data they depend on have committed.
- **Non-recoverable schedules**: Do not provide this guarantee, leading to potential data inconsistencies in the case of a failure.

## Concurrency Control

### Need for Concurrency Control

Concurrency control is essential to ensure the consistency and isolation of transactions when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously. Without it, problems such as **lost updates**, **dirty reads**, and **uncommitted data dependencies** can arise.

### Locking Methods

**Locks** are used to control access to database resources during transaction execution. Types of locks include:

- **Exclusive locks (X-lock)**: Prevents any other transaction from accessing the locked resource.
- **Shared locks (S-lock)**: Allows multiple transactions to read a resource but prevents writes.

### Deadlocks

**Deadlocks** occur when two or more transactions are waiting for resources that each other holds, creating a cycle of dependency. Techniques to handle deadlocks include:

- **Deadlock prevention**: Ensure transactions do not enter into deadlock-prone situations.
- **Deadlock detection**: Periodically check for deadlock situations and resolve them by rolling back one or more transactions.

### Time-Stamping Methods

In **time-stamping concurrency control**, each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp. Transactions are then ordered based on their timestamps to ensure consistency. Older transactions get priority in accessing data over newer ones.

### Optimistic Techniques

**Optimistic concurrency control** assumes that conflicts between transactions are rare and does not require locking. Instead, it validates transactions at commit time to ensure consistency, rolling back if conflicts are detected.

### Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

**MVCC** allows multiple versions of a data item to exist simultaneously, allowing transactions to read data without being blocked by writes. Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data as it was at the start of the transaction.

## Crash Recovery Methods

### Shadow Paging

**Shadow paging** is a recovery method that maintains two versions of the database:

- **Shadow page**: The original page before any changes are made.
- **Current page**: The modified page during the transaction.
  In the event of a crash, the system can revert to the shadow page to recover.

### Log-based Recovery: Deferred and Immediate

**Log-based recovery** uses a log to record all database operations. Two techniques are:

1. **Deferred Logging**: All updates are recorded in the log, but actual updates to the database are delayed until the transaction commits.
2. **Immediate Logging**: Updates are written to the log and database immediately, but the database is rolled back in case of failure.

### Checkpoints

A **checkpoint** is a point at which all changes made by transactions are saved to the database and logged. In the event of a crash, the system can restart from the checkpoint, reducing the amount of work needed for recovery.
