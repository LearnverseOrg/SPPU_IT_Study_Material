# Unit 2: Relational Model

## ER and EER Diagrams

The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a conceptual framework used to represent data and its relationships in a database. The **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model** is an extension of the ER Model that includes additional concepts like specialization, generalization, and categorization.

### Components of the ER Model

1. **Entities**: Objects or things in the real world with an independent existence (e.g., Customer, Product).
2. **Attributes**: Properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., Customer Name, Product Price).
3. **Relationships**: Associations between two or more entities (e.g., a Customer "purchases" a Product).
4. **Primary Key**: A unique attribute that identifies an entity.
5. **Cardinality**: Defines the number of occurrences of one entity that can be associated with another (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

### Conventions in ER Diagrams

- **Entities** are represented as rectangles.
- **Attributes** are represented as ovals connected to their respective entities.
- **Relationships** are represented as diamonds.
- **Primary Keys** are underlined in the attribute list.
- **Cardinality and Participation** are shown using lines and symbols near relationships.

### Converting ER Diagrams into Tables

To implement an ER diagram in a relational database, the following steps are taken:

1. **Entities** become tables.
2. **Attributes** become columns within the table.
3. **Primary keys** are set to ensure uniqueness.
4. **Relationships** are translated into foreign keys, connecting related tables.

## Relational Model

The **Relational Model** is the most widely used model for database management systems. It represents data in the form of relations (tables) and is based on set theory and first-order logic.

### Basic Concepts of the Relational Model

1. **Relation**: A table with rows and columns. Each table represents an entity or a relationship.
2. **Tuple**: A row in the table, representing a single record.
3. **Attribute**: A column in the table, representing a property of the entity.
4. **Primary Key**: An attribute (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies each tuple.
5. **Foreign Key**: An attribute in one relation that links to the primary key in another relation.

### Attributes and Domains

- **Attribute**: A characteristic or property of a relation (column).
- **Domain**: The set of allowable values for an attribute (e.g., integer, string, date).

### Coddâ€™s Rules

Dr. E.F. Codd defined a set of 12 rules to determine if a database system is truly relational:

1. **Rule 0**: The system must qualify as a relational database management system.
2. **Rule 1**: Data must be represented as relations (tables).
3. **Rule 2**: The system should use relational operators for manipulation (insert, delete, update).
4. **Rule 3**: Systematic treatment of null values.
5. **Rule 4**: Database description should be represented at the logical level.
6. **Rule 5**: Comprehensive data sublanguage.
7. **Rule 6**: View updating capability.
8. **Rule 7**: High-level insert, update, and delete.
9. **Rule 8**: Physical data independence.
10. **Rule 9**: Logical data independence.
11. **Rule 10**: Integrity independence.
12. **Rule 11**: Distribution independence.
13. **Rule 12**: Non-subversion rule.

## Relational Integrity

**Relational Integrity** refers to the correctness and consistency of the data stored in a relational database.

### Nulls in Relational Databases

**Null values** represent missing or unknown data in a database. They are used to indicate the absence of a value.

### Entity Integrity

**Entity Integrity** ensures that no primary key attribute contains null values, ensuring that each entity is uniquely identifiable.

### Referential Integrity

**Referential Integrity** ensures that foreign key values in a table always refer to valid primary keys in another table, maintaining the logical relationships between tables.

### Enterprise Constraints

**Enterprise Constraints** are additional rules defined by the organization to enforce specific business requirements. These constraints can be more complex than entity and referential integrity.

## Views and Schema Diagram

### Views

A **View** is a virtual table created by a query that presents a subset of data from one or more tables. It does not store data itself but dynamically retrieves it from the underlying tables.

### Schema Diagram

A **Schema Diagram** visually represents the structure of a database, including tables, columns, relationships (foreign keys), and constraints. It provides an overview of how data is organized and interconnected within the database.
