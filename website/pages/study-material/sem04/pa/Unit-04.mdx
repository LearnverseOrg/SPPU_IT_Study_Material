# Unit 4: PIC Interfacing - II

## CCP Modes

**CCP** stands for Capture/Compare/PWM, and it is one of the core features of PIC microcontrollers used to measure time events, compare signals, and generate pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. PIC microcontrollers include dedicated CCP modules that enable various time-based and control functions.

### Capture Mode

The **Capture mode** is used to capture the value of a timer at the exact moment an external event occurs. The CCP module waits for a trigger (an edge on a specific pin) and captures the current timer value at that instant. This allows us to measure external events such as the time between two pulses or the frequency of a signal.

Key Features:

- Can detect rising, falling, or both edges of an incoming signal.
- The captured value can be stored in the CCP register and then processed by the microcontroller.

#### Example Code (Capture Mode):

```c
#include <xc.h>

void capture_init() {
    TRISCbits.TRISC2 = 1;  // Set CCP1 pin as input
    CCP1CON = 0x05;        // Configure CCP1 module in Capture mode (rising edge)
    T1CON = 0x01;          // Timer1 ON with prescaler 1:1
}

void main() {
    capture_init();
    while (1) {
        if (PIR1bits.CCP1IF) {  // Check if Capture has occurred
            unsigned int captured_value = (CCPR1H << 8) + CCPR1L; // Get captured value
            PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0; // Clear the interrupt flag
        }
    }
}
```

### Compare Mode

In **Compare mode**, the CCP module compares the value of a timer with a preset value and triggers an event when the two values match. This can be used to trigger an action, like toggling a pin or generating a pulse when the timer reaches the desired count.

Key Features:

- Can generate an interrupt when the timer value matches the comparison value.
- Useful for creating precise time delays.

#### Example Code (Compare Mode):

```c
#include <xc.h>

void compare_init() {
    CCP1CON = 0x0B;       // Compare mode: Toggle output on match
    T1CON = 0x01;         // Timer1 ON with prescaler 1:1
    CCPR1 = 5000;         // Set the compare value
}

void main() {
    compare_init();
    while (1) {
        // Wait for compare event (handled by hardware)
    }
}
```

### PWM Mode

**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is a technique used to control the power delivered to a load by varying the width of the pulse while keeping the frequency constant. PWM is widely used in controlling motor speeds, LED brightness, and other power control applications.

Key Features:

- Duty cycle determines how much time the signal stays HIGH in one cycle.
- Frequency of PWM remains constant, while the duty cycle varies.

#### Example Code (PWM Mode):

```c
#include <xc.h>

void pwm_init() {
    PR2 = 255;            // Set PWM period
    CCPR1L = 128;         // Set initial duty cycle
    CCP1CON = 0x0C;       // Configure CCP1 module in PWM mode
    T2CON = 0x04;         // Timer2 ON with prescaler 1:1
}

void main() {
    pwm_init();
    while (1) {
        // Adjust the PWM duty cycle as needed
    }
}
```

## DC Motor Speed Control Using CCP

Using the PWM mode of the CCP module, we can control the speed of a **DC motor**. By varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the effective voltage applied to the motor changes, thus controlling its speed.

### How PWM Controls Motor Speed:

- **Low Duty Cycle**: Less power is delivered to the motor, making it run slower.
- **High Duty Cycle**: More power is delivered to the motor, making it run faster.

#### Example Code (DC Motor Speed Control):

```c
#include <xc.h>

void pwm_init() {
    PR2 = 255;            // Set PWM period
    CCPR1L = 128;         // Set initial duty cycle (50%)
    CCP1CON = 0x0C;       // Configure CCP1 module in PWM mode
    T2CON = 0x04;         // Timer2 ON with prescaler 1:1
}

void set_motor_speed(unsigned char duty_cycle) {
    CCPR1L = duty_cycle;  // Adjust duty cycle to control motor speed
}

void main() {
    pwm_init();
    while (1) {
        set_motor_speed(192);  // Set motor speed (75% duty cycle)
    }
}
```

## Stepper Motor Interfacing with PIC

A **Stepper motor** is a brushless DC motor that divides a full rotation into equal steps. Each step corresponds to a specific angular movement, making it ideal for precise positioning applications like CNC machines and 3D printers.

### Interfacing Steps:

1. **Half-Step or Full-Step Mode**: Choose between these modes depending on the required resolution.
2. **Driving the Coils**: Use transistors or a dedicated driver circuit to supply current to the motor coils.
3. **Control Sequence**: Send a specific sequence of HIGH and LOW signals to the motor coils to make the motor rotate.

#### Example Code (Stepper Motor Control):

```c
#include <xc.h>

void stepper_init() {
    TRISB = 0x00;        // Set PORTB as output
}

void rotate_stepper(unsigned char steps) {
    const unsigned char sequence[] = {0x09, 0x0A, 0x06, 0x05}; // Full-step sequence
    for (unsigned char i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
        for (unsigned char j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            PORTB = sequence[j];  // Apply step sequence
            __delay_ms(100);      // Delay between steps
        }
    }
}

void main() {
    stepper_init();
    while (1) {
        rotate_stepper(100);      // Rotate motor 100 steps
    }
}
```

## Serial Communication Protocols

### RS232

**RS232** is a serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication. It involves a **transmit** and **receive** pin, and data is transmitted in bits (one bit at a time).

- Voltage levels: RS232 uses **+12V** and **-12V** for signaling.
- Baud rate: Defines how fast data is transmitted (e.g., 9600 baud).

### I2C

**I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a two-wire protocol used for communication between multiple ICs. The two wires are:

- **SCL (Serial Clock)**: Used to synchronize the communication.
- **SDA (Serial Data)**: Used to transmit and receive data.

I2C allows communication between multiple devices, where each device has a unique address.

### SPI

**SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)** is a four-wire communication protocol commonly used to interface sensors, SD cards, and display modules with microcontrollers. The wires are:

- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: Data sent from master to slave.
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: Data sent from slave to master.
- **SCLK (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal for synchronization.
- **SS (Slave Select)**: Selects which slave device to communicate with.

### UART

**UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** is a widely used protocol for serial communication. It involves only two data lines:

- **TX (Transmit)**: Sends data from the microcontroller.
- **RX (Receive)**: Receives data into the microcontroller.

## Serial Communication Programming using Embedded C

### RS232 Example:

```c
#include <xc.h>

void uart_init() {
    TXSTAbits.TXEN = 1;  // Enable UART transmission
    RCSTAbits.SPEN = 1;  // Enable UART module
    SPBRG = 25;          // Set baud rate to 9600
}

void uart_write(char data) {
    while (!TXSTAbits.TRMT);  // Wait until buffer is empty
    TXREG = data;             // Transmit data
}

void main() {
    uart_init();
    uart_write('A');          // Send character 'A'
    while (1);
}
```

### I2C Example:

```c
char i2c_read_ack() {
    SSPCON2bits.RCEN = 1; // Enable receive mode
    while (!SSPSTATbits.BF); // Wait for data
    return SSPBUF;        // Return received data
}

char i2c_read_nack() {
    SSPCON2bits.RCEN = 1; // Enable receive mode
    while (!SSPSTATbits.BF); // Wait for data
    SSPCON2bits.ACKDT = 1; // Send NACK
    SSPCON2bits.ACKEN = 1; // Send ACK
    return SSPBUF;        // Return received data
}

void main() {
    i2c_init();
    i2c_start();
    i2c_write(0xA0); // Device address
    char data = i2c_read_nack(); // Read data with NACK
    while (1);
}
```

### SPI Example:

```cpp
char spi_read() {
    SSPBUF = 0xFF;       // Send dummy byte to generate clock
    while (!SSPSTATbits.BF); // Wait for transmission to complete
    return SSPBUF;       // Read received data
}

void main() {
    spi_init();
    while (1) {
        char data = spi_read(); // Read data from SPI
    }
}
```
