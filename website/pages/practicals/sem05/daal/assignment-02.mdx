## Title

Implementing the Bellman-Ford Algorithm Using Dynamic Programming

## Theory

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weights and can detect negative weight cycles. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming and follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.
2. **Relaxation**: For each edge, update the distance to the destination vertex if a shorter path is found. This step is repeated for all vertices minus one.
3. **Negative Cycle Detection**: Check for negative weight cycles by verifying if further relaxation is possible. If any distance is updated, a negative weight cycle exists.

The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is \(O(V \cdot E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void bellmanFord(int v, int e, vector<vector<int>> &graph) {
    vector<int> dist(v, INT_MAX);
    dist[0] = 0;

    // Relax all edges |V| - 1 times.
    for (int i = 0; i < v - 1; i++) {
        for (auto edge : graph) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];
            if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for negative-weight cycles.
    for (auto edge : graph) {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];
        int w = edge[2];
        if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
            cout << "Negative cycle detected" << endl;
            return;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
        cout << "Distance of vertex " << i << " from source is " << dist[i] << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int v, e;
    cout << "Enter the number of vertices and edges: ";
    cin >> v >> e;

    vector<vector<int>> graph;

    for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
        int u, v, w;
        cout << "Enter the source, destination and weight of edge " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        graph.push_back({u, v, w});
    }

    auto start = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    bellmanFord(v, e, graph);
    auto end = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;
    cout << "Time taken by Bellman-Ford algorithm: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Setup and Run

### Step 1: Save the Code

Save the code as `bellman_ford.cpp`.

### Step 2: Compile the Code

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved. Compile the program using the GCC compiler:

```sh
g++ -o bellman_ford bellman_ford.cpp -std=c++11
```

### Step 3: Run the Program

Run the compiled program:

```sh
./bellman_ford
```

## Example

Input:

```
Enter the number of vertices and edges: 5 8
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 1: 0 1 -1
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 2: 0 2 4
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 3: 1 2 3
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 4: 1 3 2
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 5: 1 4 2
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 6: 3 2 5
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 7: 3 1 1
Enter the source, destination and weight of edge 8: 4 3 -3
```

Output:

```
Distance of vertex 0 from source is 0
Distance of vertex 1 from source is -1
Distance of vertex 2 from source is 2
Distance of vertex 3 from source is -2
Distance of vertex 4 from source is 1
Time taken by Bellman-Ford algorithm: X seconds
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:

   - The distance to the source vertex (vertex 0) is set to 0.
   - The distances to all other vertices are set to infinity.

2. **Relaxation**:

   - For each edge, the algorithm updates the distance to the destination vertex if a shorter path is found.
   - This step is repeated for \(V-1\) times (where \(V\) is the number of vertices).

3. **Negative Cycle Detection**:
   - The algorithm checks for negative weight cycles by verifying if further relaxation is possible. If any distance is updated in this step, it indicates the presence of a negative weight cycle.

By running this program, you will observe how the Bellman-Ford algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph, handles negative weights, and detects negative weight cycles. The output also includes the time taken to execute the algorithm, demonstrating its time complexity.
