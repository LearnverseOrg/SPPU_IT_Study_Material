## 1. **echo**

The `echo` command is used to display a line of text or a variable value.

```sh
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## 2. **ls**

The `ls` command lists directory contents.

```sh
ls
ls -l  # long listing format
ls -a  # all files including hidden files
```

## 3. **read**

The `read` command is used to read input from the user.

```sh
echo "Enter your name: "
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

## 4. **cat**

The `cat` command concatenates and displays file content.

```sh
cat filename.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```

## 5. **touch**

The `touch` command is used to create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.

```sh
touch newfile.txt
```

## 6. **test**

The `test` command checks file types and compares values.

```sh
test -f filename.txt && echo "File exists."
```

## 7. **Loops**

### For Loop

```sh
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### While Loop

```sh
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Counter: $counter"
  ((counter++))
done
```

## 8. **Arithmetic Comparison**

```sh
a=5
b=10
if [ $a -lt $b ]
then
  echo "$a is less than $b"
fi
```

## 9. **Conditional Loops**

### If-Else

```sh
if [ $a -lt $b ]
then
  echo "$a is less than $b"
else
  echo "$a is not less than $b"
fi
```

### Case Statement

```sh
echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3:"
read num
case $num in
  1) echo "You entered one.";;
  2) echo "You entered two.";;
  3) echo "You entered three.";;
  *) echo "Invalid number.";;
esac
```

## 10. **grep**

The `grep` command searches for patterns in files.

```sh
grep "pattern" file.txt
grep -i "pattern" file.txt  # case insensitive
```

## 11. **sed**

The `sed` command is a stream editor used for basic text transformations.

```sh
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt  # replace first occurrence of 'old' with 'new'
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt  # replace all occurrences of 'old' with 'new'
```

## Practical Examples

```sh
# Create files
touch file1.txt file2.txt

# List files in long format
ls -l

# Read user input
echo "Enter your favorite color: "
read color
echo "Your favorite color is $color."

# Concatenate file contents
echo "Hello" > file1.txt
echo "World" > file2.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
cat combined.txt

# Conditional and Arithmetic Comparison
a=3
b=7
if [ $a -lt $b ]
then
  echo "$a is less than $b"
fi

# Loop through numbers
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done

# Search pattern in a file
echo "apple" > fruits.txt
echo "banana" >> fruits.txt
grep "apple" fruits.txt

# Substitute text in a file
echo "The sky is blue." > sentence.txt
sed 's/blue/clear/' sentence.txt
```
