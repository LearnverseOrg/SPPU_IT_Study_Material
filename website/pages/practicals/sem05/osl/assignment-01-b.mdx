## Title

Address Book Management System

## Theory

An Address Book Management System is a program designed to store, retrieve, and manage contact information. This includes functionalities like creating an address book, viewing existing records, inserting new records, deleting records, searching for specific records, and updating existing records. This script is implemented in Bash, a Unix shell and command language, to demonstrate basic file operations and user interaction through command-line interface.

## Code Implementation

### `main.sh` Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if the address book file exists
fileExists(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        return 1
    fi
}

# Function to create the address book file
createAddressBook(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        touch Address_Book.txt
    fi
    echo "| Name | Email | Phone Number | Address |" > Address_Book.txt
}

# Function to view the address book
viewAddressBook(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        echo "Address Book is Not Created. First Create Address Book"
        return
    fi

    if [ -s Address_Book.txt ]; then
        cat Address_Book.txt
    else
        echo "Address Book is Empty"
    fi
}

# Function to insert a record into the address book
insertRecord(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        echo "Address Book is Not Created. First Create Address Book"
        return
    fi

    read -p "Enter Name: " name
    read -p "Enter Email: " email
    read -p "Enter Phone Number: " phone
    read -p "Enter Address: " address

    echo "| $name | $email | $phone | $address |" >> Address_Book.txt
}

# Function to delete a record from the address book
deleteRecord(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        echo "Address Book is Not Created. First Create Address Book"
        return
    fi

    read -p "Enter Name: " name
    if [ -z "$(grep -i $name Address_Book.txt)" ]; then
        echo "Record Not Found"
    else
        sed -i "/$name/d" Address_Book.txt
    fi
}

# Function to search for a record in the address book
searchRecord(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        echo "Address Book is Not Created. First Create Address Book"
        return
    fi

    read -p "Enter Name: " name
    if [ -z "$(grep -i $name Address_Book.txt)" ]; then
        echo "Record Not Found"
    else
        grep -i $name Address_Book.txt
    fi
}

# Function to update a record in the address book
updateRecord(){
    if [ ! -e Address_Book.txt ]; then
        echo "Address Book is Not Created. First Create Address Book"
        return
    fi

    read -p "Enter Name: " name

    if [ -z "$(grep -i $name Address_Book.txt)" ]; then
        echo "Record Not Found"
        return
    fi

    sed -i "/$name/d" Address_Book.txt
    read -p "Enter Email: " email
    read -p "Enter Phone Number: " phone
    read -p "Enter Address: " address
    echo "| $name | $email | $phone | $address |" >> Address_Book.txt
}

# Main function to display the menu and handle user input
main(){
    while true; do
        echo -e "\nWelcome to Address Book\n"
        echo "1. Create Address Book"
        echo "2. View Address Book"
        echo "3. Insert Record"
        echo "4. Delete Record"
        echo "5. Search Record"
        echo "6. Update Record"
        echo -e "7. Exit\n"

        read -p "Enter Choice: " choice

        case $choice in
            1)
            createAddressBook
            ;;
            2)
            viewAddressBook
            ;;
            3)
            insertRecord
            ;;
            4)
            deleteRecord
            ;;
            5)
            searchRecord
            ;;
            6)
            updateRecord
            ;;
            7)
            exit
            ;;
            *)
            echo "Invalid Choice"
            ;;
        esac
    done
}

# Run the main function
main
```

## Setup and Run

### Step 1: Save the Script

Save the script as `main.sh`.

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Before running the script, you need to make it executable. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
chmod +x main.sh
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

Now you can run the script by executing:

```sh
./main.sh
```

## Example Usage

After running the script, you will see the menu options:

```
Welcome to Address Book

1. Create Address Book
2. View Address Book
3. Insert Record
4. Delete Record
5. Search Record
6. Update Record
7. Exit

Enter Choice:
```

- **Create Address Book**: Choose option 1 to create the address book.
- **View Address Book**: Choose option 2 to view the contents of the address book.
- **Insert Record**: Choose option 3 to add a new record to the address book.
- **Delete Record**: Choose option 4 to delete a record from the address book.
- **Search Record**: Choose option 5 to search for a specific record by name.
- **Update Record**: Choose option 6 to update a record in the address book.
- **Exit**: Choose option 7 to exit the program.

The script allows for basic address book operations, storing data in a text file called `Address_Book.txt`. This solution can be further extended with more features and improved error handling as needed.
